"""
A closure is a record storing a function[a] together with an environment:
 a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally, but
 defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when
 the closure was created.A closure—unlike a plain function—allows the function to access those
 captured variables through the closure's copies of their values or references, even when the function
 is invoked outside their scope.
